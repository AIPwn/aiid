# aiid-capture

A work-in-progress repository for capturing the data associated with publicly available URLs detailing AI Incidents.

Development is currently being carried out on the `develop` branch, with periodic unversioned merges to `master`.

## Setup

1. `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
2. Install [PDFing library](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html)

## TODO

* Play with the PDF capture script to make the captured PDFs more friendly visually. It supports user CSS script injection. https://pypi.org/project/pdfkit/
